# Recursive Templates in SVG and HTML

## About the Project

This project explores the use of recursive templates in SVG and HTML, with an approach to embedding and processing nested content. The primary focus is on SVG templates that use special placeholders, which can be dynamically replaced with actual content from various sources.

The project includes examples and a library for processing SVGs and HTML files that contain recursive templates. These templates can be used in a variety of applications, from dynamic image generation to complex web content structuring.

## Features

- **Recursive SVG Processing**: SVG templates with nested `esc://` URIs, allowing for dynamic content embedding and replacement.
- **HTML Template Support**: Similar functionality extended to HTML templates.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Fetch and embed content based on unique transaction hashes identifiers.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Optimized for handling deeply nested structures without performance degradation.
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Suitable for a wide range of applications, including Web3, on-chain NFTs of various media formats, and data visualization.
